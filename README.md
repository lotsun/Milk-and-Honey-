<p>
  The website has been updated to make use of the new and improved Boostrap 5 features to create a more user-friendly interface. Navigation has been made easier and better integrated with the user's experience. Icons, buttons, and other graphical elements have all been styled using the latest Boostrap 5 framework. Images of book covers have been downloaded from Unplash, and the Call To Action (CTA) buttons are active and responsive, providing the user with a dynamic experience. The website also includes a review section for users to leave comments and feedback, which has been improved upon in this updated version. All of these design elements have been implemented to give the user a unique and enjoyable experience while visiting the website.</p>
